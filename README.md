Fight an opponent with a click of a button.
## About The Project
I'm currently refreshing my JavaScript skills and this project came from the instructor's course. He told us to change parts of the code so I did. I changed quite a bit that I decided to make this a separate game with various improvements.
## How To Play The Game
Download all the files into the same folder onto your computer. Open the index.html in your favorite browser and click the buttons to fight the opponent with normal or strong attacks. You can also heal yourself. Finally, you can view the battle log once the fight ends.
